# Castle Wars Mini-Game
A Minecraft Minigame based on BedWars and the Roblox game "Doomspire Brickbattle"

# FAQ
So, what is Castle Wars?
Castle wars is my own version of the minigame “doomspire brickbattle” on roblox. There are two teams with their own castles, each castle has several spawning platforms that allow its members to spawn. The goal is to destroy all of the opponents spawning platforms and finish them off. Like bedwars 4v4, but there are multiple beds 
How can i break spawn platforms?
You will be unable to break blocks yourself, so you have to use the custom weapons available:
- Torpedo - spawns a slimeblock flying machine that explodes when stopped 
- Bomb - places a lit tnt
- Rapid Fire - Places a rapidfire arrow despenser
- There are of course the usual bows, axes & swords (even fire charges)
How do I win?
If all the opponents are permanently dead
